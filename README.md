# ML-From-Scratch: A Comprehensive Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

Welcome to the **ML-From-Scratch** repository, a meticulously crafted collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from the ground up using Python and NumPy. This project is designed to serve as an educational resource, providing clear insights into the foundational mechanics of various machine learning models without the abstraction of high-level libraries.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to demystify the core principles of machine learning by offering transparent implementations of widely used algorithms. By constructing these algorithms from scratch, we aim to enhance understanding and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in the field of machine learning.

## Implemented Algorithms

This repository encompasses a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:

- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Neural Networks

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis

- **Reinforcement Learning:**
  - Q-Learning

Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on clarity and educational value, emphasizing the underlying mathematics and logic that drive these models.

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahammadnafiz/ML-From-Scratch.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ML-From-Scratch
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   ```

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained within its respective directory and includes a Python script demonstrating its functionality. To run an algorithm:

1. **Navigate to the Linear Regression Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ML from Scratch/Linear Regression  # Example for Linear Regression
   ```

2. **Execute the Implementation Script:**
   ```bash
   python Linear_Regression.py
   ```

These scripts are designed to be self-explanatory, with comments and documentation to guide you through the implementation details.
