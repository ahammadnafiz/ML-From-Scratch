### Context

- $w[l]$: Weights of the layer l.
- $dw^l$: Gradient of the loss with respect to $w[l]$, which has two components:
    1. The gradient from backpropagation (based on the loss function).
    2. The gradient from L2 regularization, $λ/m \cdot w[l]$, where:
        - λ\lambda: Regularization strength.
        - m: Number of training examples.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Weight Update Rule**:
    
$$
    w[l] = w[l] - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot dw[l]
$$
    
    This is the general formula for gradient descent.
    
2. **Expand dw[l]**: With L2 regularization, dw[l] consists of two parts:
    
$$
    dw[l] = (\text{from backpropagation}) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \cdot w[l]
$$
    
    Substituting this into the update rule:
    
$$
    w[l] = w[l] - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot \left((\text{from backpropagation}) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \cdot w[l]\right)
$$
3. **Distribute the Learning Rate**: Distribute learning_rate:
    
$$
    w[l] = w[l] - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{m} \cdot w[l] - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot (\text{from backpropagation})
$$
4. **Factorize w[l]**: The term involving w[l] can be factored out:
    
$$
    w[l] = \left(1 - \frac{\text{learning\_rate} \cdot \lambda}{m}\right) \cdot w[l] - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot (\text{from backpropagation})
$$

### Interpretation of Terms

1. **Decay Factor**:
    
    $\left(1 - \frac{\text{learning\_rate} \cdot \lambda}{m}\right)$
    - This is a multiplicative decay factor applied to w[l]. It reduces the magnitude of the weights in each iteration, effectively shrinking them towards zero. This is the key mechanism of **L2 regularization**, which discourages large weights.
2. **Gradient Descent Step**:
    
$$
    - \text{learning\_rate} \cdot (\text{from backpropagation})
$$
    - This is the standard gradient descent update, which adjusts the weights based on the loss gradient.

### Why This Decomposition?

- The term $\left(1 - \frac{\text{learning\_rate} \cdot \lambda}{m}\right)$ highlights how L2 regularization applies a penalty to large weights, ensuring they decay gradually.
- By separating the weight decay and the gradient descent step, we can better understand how regularization and optimization work together.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def update_weights(W_list, dW_list, learning_rate, lambda_reg, m):
    """
    Updates the weights with L2 regularization (weight decay).
    
    Parameters:
    W_list -- list of weight matrices for each layer
    dW_list -- list of gradients of the weight matrices from backpropagation
    learning_rate -- the learning rate used for updating weights
    lambda_reg -- L2 regularization hyperparameter (controls weight decay)
    m -- number of training examples
    
    Returns:
    W_list -- updated list of weight matrices
    """
    for l in range(len(W_list)):
        # Update rule with weight decay (L2 regularization)
        W_list[l] = (1 - (learning_rate * lambda_reg) / m) * W_list[l] - learning_rate * dW_list[l]
    
    return W_list

# Example usage
# Assuming you have the following variables: W_list, dW_list, learning_rate, lambda_reg, m
# W_list: A list of multidimensional weight matrices (W1, W2, ..., WL)
# dW_list: A list of gradients of weights obtained from backpropagation
# learning_rate: The learning rate
# lambda_reg: Regularization parameter (lambda)
# m: Number of examples

W_list_updated = update_weights(W_list, dW_list, learning_rate, lambda_reg, m)
```

### Explanation:
1. **`W_list[l]`**: The current weight matrix of layer `l`.
2. **`dW_list[l]`**: The gradient of the weight matrix \( $\text{d}w[l]$ \) from backpropagation.
3. **`(1 - (learning_rate * lambda_reg) / m)`**: This term scales the weights, implementing weight decay.
4. **`learning_rate * dW_list[l]`**: The standard gradient descent step from backpropagation.
5. **Weight Decay**: By including the factor  $\left(1 - \frac{\text{learning\_rate} \cdot \lambda}{m}\right)$, we ensure that the weights decay in proportion to their size. This helps reduce overfitting by penalizing large weights.

### Notes:
- **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)**: The term \( $\frac{\lambda}{m} \cdot w[l]$ \) penalizes large weights, and the factor \( $\left(1 - \frac{\text{learning\_rate} \cdot \lambda}{m}\right)$ \) effectively causes the weights to "decay" by shrinking them on every update.
- **Gradient Descent**: This approach combines standard gradient descent with regularization.

This method ensures that the weights both learn from backpropagation and are regularized through weight decay.
