[[Backpropagation Intuitive Overview]]
### L1 Regularization:
L1 regularization penalizes the **absolute value** of the weights, encouraging sparsity in the network by driving some weights towards zero.

### L2 Regularization:
L2 regularization penalizes the **squared** value of the weights, which helps to reduce overfitting by discouraging large weight values.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_cost(Y, Y_pred, W_list, b, m, L, lambda_l1, lambda_l2):
    """
    Computes the cost function J(w,b) for a neural network with L1 and L2 regularization.
    
    Parameters:
    Y -- actual labels, numpy array of shape (m, num_classes)
    Y_pred -- predicted labels, numpy array of shape (m, num_classes)
    W_list -- list of weight matrices for each layer, where each W is multidimensional
    b -- list of bias vectors for each layer (not directly used in L1 or L2 regularization)
    m -- number of training examples
    L -- loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss)
    lambda_l1 -- L1 regularization hyperparameter

### Explanation:
1. **L1 Regularization** (`l1_regularization`):
   - Computed as the sum of the absolute values of all the elements in each weight matrix: `np.sum(np.abs(W_l))`.
   - L1 encourages sparsity by driving some weights to zero.

2. **L2 Regularization** (`l2_regularization`):
   - Computed as the sum of the squared values of all the elements in each weight matrix: `np.sum(np.square(W_l))`.
   - L2 prevents large weight values.

3. **Cost**:
   - The total cost is the sum of the loss function, the L1 regularization term (scaled by `lambda_l1`), and the L2 regularization term (scaled by `lambda_l2`).
   
### Inputs:
- `lambda_l1`: Controls the strength of L1 regularization.
- `lambda_l2`: Controls the strength of L2 regularization.
- `W_list`: List of weight matrices (could be multidimensional).
- `m`: Number of training examples.

This function provides flexibility to adjust both regularization types simultaneously based on the problem.
