Sure! Let's update the notations as you requested. We will use \( dZ[l] \), \( W[l+1] \), \( $g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])$ \), and \( $dZ[l+1]$ \) while keeping the same explanation. Here's the updated derivation:

### Updated Notation:
- \( dZ[l] \): Error term at layer \( l \) (this corresponds to \( $\delta^{(l)}$ \) in the previous notation).
- \( W[l+1] \): Weights from layer \( l \) to layer \( l+1 \).
- \( $g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])$ \): Derivative of the ReLU activation function applied to the pre-activation \( Z[l] \).
- \( $dZ[l+1]$ \): Error term from the next layer, i.e., layer \( l+1 \).

Now, let’s derive the formula:

### Step-by-Step Derivation

#### 1. Define the Loss Function
Let \( E \) be the error or loss function. We want to minimize this loss during training. For simplicity, assume that the loss is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \| a[L] - y \|^2
$$

Where:
- \( a[L] \) is the activation of the output layer (i.e., the network's prediction),
- \( y \) is the true label.

#### 2. Define the Activations and Pre-Activations
At each layer \( l \), we have:
- \( Z[l] = W[l] a[l-1] + b[l] \), the **pre-activation** at layer \( l \), i.e., the weighted sum of inputs from the previous layer,
- \( a[l] = g(Z[l]) \), where \( g \) is the activation function (such as ReLU, sigmoid, etc.). In this case, we’re using **ReLU** as the activation function.

Our goal is to compute \( dZ[l] \), which is the error term at layer \( l \), representing the contribution of this layer's neurons to the overall error.

#### 3. Chain Rule for Backpropagation
The chain rule allows us to compute \( \frac{\partial E}{\partial Z[l]} \) (i.e., \( dZ[l] \)) by relating it to \( dZ[l+1] \) from the next layer and the activation function's derivative. Applying the chain rule:


$$
dZ[l] = \frac{\partial E}{\partial Z[l]} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} \cdot \frac{\partial a[l]}{\partial Z[l]}
$$


Breaking it down:
- **\( $\frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]}$ \)** represents how much the error changes with respect to the activation \( a[l] \) in layer \( l \).
- **\( $\frac{\partial a[l]}{\partial Z[l]} = g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])$ \)** is the derivative of the activation function with respect to the pre-activation \( Z[l] \). For the ReLU activation, this is:
  - \( $g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l]) = 1$ \) if \( $Z[l] > 0$ \),
  - \( $g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l]) = 0$ \) otherwise.

Thus, we get:

$$
dZ[l] = \frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} \cdot g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])
$$

Now, we need to compute \( \frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} \), which propagates back from the next layer.

#### 4. Error Propagation from Layer \( l+1 \)
The activations \( a[l] \) in layer \( l \) affect the pre-activation \( Z[l+1] \) in the next layer via the weight matrix \( W[l+1] \). Thus, the error in layer \( l+1 \) influences the error in layer \( l \). Using the chain rule:


$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial Z[l+1]} \cdot \frac{\partial Z[l+1]}{\partial a[l]}
$$


Where:
- \( $\frac{\partial E}{\partial Z[l+1]} = dZ[l+1]$ \) (the error term in layer \( l+1 \)),
- \( $\frac{\partial Z[l+1]}{\partial a[l]} = W[l+1]$ \) (since \( Z[l+1] = W[l+1] a[l] + b[l+1] \)).

Thus, we have:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} = W[l+1]^T dZ[l+1]
$$


This tells us how the error in the next layer \( l+1 \) propagates back to the current layer \( l \).

#### 5. Putting it All Together
Now, substitute this result back into the expression for \( dZ[l] \):


$$
dZ[l] = \frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} \cdot g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])
$$


Substituting \( $\frac{\partial E}{\partial a[l]} = W[l+1]^T dZ[l+1]$ \):


$$
dZ[l] = W[l+1]^T dZ[l+1] \cdot g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])
$$


This is the final formula for the error at layer \( l \).

### Explanation of the Final Formula:
- **\( dZ[l] \)**: The error term for layer \( l \), representing how much the neurons in this layer contribute to the total error.
- **\( W[l+1]^T \)**: The transpose of the weight matrix from layer \( l+1 \), which propagates the error back from the next layer to the current layer.
- **\( dZ[l+1] \)**: The error term for the next layer \( l+1 \), representing how much the neurons in layer \( l+1 \) contribute to the overall error.
- **\( $g_{\text{ReLU}}'(Z[l])$ \)**: The derivative of the ReLU activation function at layer \( l \). It tells us how sensitive the activations at this layer are to changes in their inputs. For ReLU, it's either 1 (for positive values of \( Z[l] \)) or 0 (for non-positive values of \( Z[l] \)).
