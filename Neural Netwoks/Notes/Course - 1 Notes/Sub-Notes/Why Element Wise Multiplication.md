The equation \( $dz[1] = dA[1] \odot ReLU'(z[1])$ \) comes from the chain rule applied during backpropagation in a neural network. Let’s break it down step by step.

### Understanding the Backpropagation Process:

1. **Forward Pass**:
   - At layer 1, you calculate the pre-activation \( $z[1] = W[1]A[0] + b[1]$ \).
   - The activation function applied to \( z[1] \) is ReLU, so:
 
$$
     A[1] = \text{ReLU}(z[1]) = \max(0, z[1])
$$

   
2. **During Backpropagation**:
   - You’re computing how the loss changes with respect to \( z[1] \) (i.e., \( $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z[1]}$ \)).
   - The gradients from the next layer (layer 2) are passed to you as \( dA[1] \), which is \( $\frac{\partial L}{\partial A[1]}$ \).
   - To calculate \( $dz[1] = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z[1]}$ \), you need to apply the **chain rule**:
 
$$
     dz[1] = \frac{\partial L}{\partial A[1]} \cdot \frac{\partial A[1]}{\partial z[1]}
$$
 

### Why Element-Wise Multiplication?

- The activation function in the hidden layers is **ReLU**:
  
$$
  A[1] = \max(0, z[1])
$$
  
- The derivative of ReLU, \( $\text{ReLU}'(z[1])$ \), is:
  
$$
  \text{ReLU}'(z[1]) = 
  \begin{cases} 
      1 & \text{if } z[1] > 0 \\
      0 & \text{if } z[1] \leq 0
  \end{cases}
$$
  
- This derivative is applied **element-wise** because the ReLU function acts on each element of \( z[1] \) independently. For each element \( z[1][i] \), the gradient passes through only if \( z[1][i] > 0 \), otherwise, it is stopped.

### Combining the Gradients:
- The chain rule gives:
  
$$
  dz[1] = dA[1] \odot \text{ReLU}'(z[1])
$$
  
  - \( dA[1] \) contains the gradients coming from the next layer.
  - \( $\text{ReLU}'(z[1])$ \) tells us which elements of \( z[1] \) allow the gradient to flow back:
    - For elements where \( $z[1] > 0$ \), the gradient is preserved (multiplied by 1).
    - For elements where \( $z[1] \leq 0$ \), the gradient is stopped (multiplied by 0).

### Summary:
- \( $dz[1] = dA[1] \odot \text{ReLU}'(z[1])$ \) is the element-wise product of:
  - \( dA[1] \), the gradients from the next layer, and
  - \( $\text{ReLU}'(z[1])$ \), the derivative of the ReLU activation function.
  
This ensures that gradients are only propagated back where the ReLU was "active" (i.e., \( z[1] > 0 \)).
