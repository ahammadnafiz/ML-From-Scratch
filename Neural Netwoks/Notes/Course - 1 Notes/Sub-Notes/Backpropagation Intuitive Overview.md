### **Key Notations:**
- $Z^{[l]}$ : Pre-activation (input to activation function in layer \( l ).
- $A^{[l]}$: Post-activation (output of the activation function in layer \( l ).
- $W^{[l]}$: Weight matrix for layer \( l \).
- $b^{[l]}$: Bias vector for layer \( l \).
- $Y$ : Ground truth label.
- $g^{[l]}$: Activation function for layer \( l \) (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).
-  $m$ : Number of examples in the batch.

### **Backpropagation Formulas Explained:**

#### **1. Final Layer Derivatives (Layer \( L \))**
These formulas apply to the output layer and use the predicted values from the forward pass.

- **Loss derivative w.r.t. pre-activation:**
  
$$
  dZ^{[L]} = A^{[L]} - Y
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: This is the gradient of the loss with respect to \( $Z^{[L]}$ \). It's the difference between the prediction  $A^{[L]}$ and the true labels \( Y \).

- **Weight gradient for layer \( L \):**
  
$$
  dW^{[L]} = \frac{1}{m} dZ^{[L]} (A^{[L-1]})^T
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: The gradient of the loss with respect to the weights in layer \( L \) is computed by multiplying the error \( $dZ^{[L]}$ \) with the activations from the previous layer, then averaged over the examples.

- **Bias gradient for layer \( L \):**
  
$$
  db^{[L]} = \frac{1}{m} \sum dZ^{[L]} \quad \text{(sum over examples)}
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: The gradient with respect to the bias \( $b^{[L]}$ \) is the average of the error \( $dZ^{[L]}$ \) across all examples.

---

#### **2. Backpropagation to Earlier Layers**
Once the gradients are computed for the output layer, the error is propagated backward through the network.

- **Gradient of loss w.r.t. pre-activation of layer \( L-1 \):**
  
$$
  dZ^{[L-1]} = W^{[L]^T} dZ^{[L]} \ast g'^{[L-1]}(Z^{[L-1]})
$$
[[Why Element Wise Multiplication]]
  - **Explanation**: To compute the error for layer \( L-1 \), you backpropagate the error from layer \( L \) using the weights \( $W^{[L]}$ \), and multiply element-wise by the derivative of the activation function \( $g'^{[L-1]}$ \) applied to \( $Z^{[L-1]}$ \).

---

#### **3. General Formula for Any Layer (e.g., Layer \( l \))**
The same pattern is followed for earlier layers, repeating the process recursively.

- **Loss derivative w.r.t. pre-activation of layer \( l \):**
  
$$
  dZ^{[l]} = W^{[l+1]^T} dZ^{[l+1]} \ast g'^{[l]}(Z^{[l]})
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: For any hidden layer, the error is backpropagated from the next layer \( l+1 \) using the corresponding weights, followed by element-wise multiplication with the activation derivative.

- **Weight gradient for layer \( l \):**
  
$$
  dW^{[l]} = \frac{1}{m} dZ^{[l]} (A^{[l-1]})^T
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: Similar to the output layer, you compute the weight gradient by multiplying the current layerâ€™s error by the activations of the previous layer, and then average over the batch.

- **Bias gradient for layer \( l \):**
  
$$
  db^{[l]} = \frac{1}{m} \sum dZ^{[l]} \quad \text{(sum over examples)}
$$
  
  - **Explanation**: The bias gradient is the average of the error across all examples.

### **Additional Notes:**
- **Activation function derivative**: The term \( $g'^{[l]}(Z^{[l]})$ \) represents the derivative of the activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU). This is critical as it controls how much error is propagated back through the network.
  
- **Element-wise multiplication**: The notation \( \ast \) denotes element-wise multiplication, meaning that the error is adjusted layer-wise for each node in the layer based on the activation derivative.

- **Transpose**: The matrix transpose (e.g., \( $W^{[l]^T}$ \)) is crucial for ensuring that the dimensions match during the backpropagation of the error from one layer to the next.

---

### **Key Intuition:**
1. **Forward Pass**: During the forward pass, we compute the predictions and activations for each layer.
2. **Backward Pass**: In the backward pass, we calculate how much the network's output deviates from the true values and propagate this error backward through the layers. We update the weights and biases based on this error to minimize the loss.
